For HW2, you will all work with the same dataset Download the same datasetI put together. You will use x1-x15 to predict "y"; ignore "yc" for now.

Your submission will consist of a Python script or Jupyter Notebook with the following clearly marked steps:

1. [5pts] indicate path where the data is to be imported from.

2. [5pts] load data as a pandas dataframe

3. [5pts] split your data (80/20 or 70/30, for example) for your own training and testing datasets. Make sure to use a random seed prior to splitting.

4. [10pts] investigate the training data (min, max, missings, histogram)

5. [10pts] prepare the datasets for modeling (think about the next step); you may want to standardize variables, fill in missing values, etc.

6. [10pts] use at least 3 models chosen from among those studied in class (Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes, KNN) and train them on the training data (you may want to reset again the random seed)

7. [10pts] plot the ROC and find the AUC for each model on both the train and the test datasets you split off in #3

8. [10pts] comment on your findings: how do the 3 models compare? do you see any overfitting or concerns with your models?

Your scripts must run without issues (5pts); these points will be deducted for non-functioning scripts (other than changing one path for loading the initial dataset). Make sure you do NOT include any personally identifiable information (name or nickname, path in your computer - replace this with <<include_here_path_to_file>>).

So far you get 70 points.

You will also grade 2 of your peers' submissions, using the requirements above (each "worth" as indicated in brackets). You get another 15 points for each submission "graded" with helpful comments if needed. Your grading should be completed and submitted by Monday 03/18.

Let me know if you have questions. Godspeed! Razvan.
