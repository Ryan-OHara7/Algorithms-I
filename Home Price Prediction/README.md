This is the final assignment for this class. This will be a team project.

I created groups for the Final, open to self-sign-up. Please (self-)assign to a group; let me know if you need help, but there should be enough space to fit in. You may have to work with colleagues you haven't worked with before...

1. Find a good problem (question) to study - and a relevant dataset. The question should be answerable through modeling with either regression or classification methods.

-- share the problem and dataset with me, to validate it is a good/reasonable choice

2. Develop a series of scripts addressing the stages of a modeling pipeline:

 a. Import the dataset (or datasets, if you end up using multiple)

 b.Clean-up, investigate, standardize etc. the variables

 c. Split in train, validate and test datasets

 d. Fit several regression or classification models (potentially both) on training dataset; use the validation dataset to select optimal hyperparameters and the final model

 e. Fit the model selected

 f. Create either a "webpage" (e.g. with Flask) or a presentation (PPT, Markdown) detailing the question, dataset choice and the stage and decisions above

 3. The final presentation will consist of the whole team presenting on their work; questions from the audience

 4. The dataset (or link to it), code and presentation will be submitted via Git

 5. The code should be written, and your model should be stored, in such a way that it can predict on a new example provided by the audience.

Let me know if you have questions. We'll refine these requirements together as you have questions.
